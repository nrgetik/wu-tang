## roadmap

* Rather than a binary system for incorporating hourly data points, implement a
  system which assigns a weight to each hour (or possibly multi-hour segment?)
  of the day.
* Ultimately create a distribution of niceness for each place that describes
  the probability of a nice day for a year. Integrate these distributions for
  a "final" niceness score.
